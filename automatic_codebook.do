This variable is equivalent to the one used in CNEF (and as such corresponding to a respective variable in CNEF files for datasets which provide them). However, the variable has some limitations: 

-	categories of 'single' and 'living with partner' not fully precise and can be contradictory to other variables 

-	country differences in inclusion of having/living with partner

-	country differences in definition of ‘single’ 

-	Living with a partner has a priority over divorced/widowed/separated

Therefore, it is recommended to use <<dd_docx_display italic: "mlstat5">> 
or <<dd_docx_display italic: "parstat6">> for analyzing CPF data.

Due to differences in questionnaires, it is not possible to fully harmonize information of respondent’s children. Therefore, CPF includes several versions of children-related variables:
putdocx textblock end

cpfbookAavlb kidsn_hh17 kidsn_hh15 kidsn_all kids_any

putdocx textblock begin, paramode
The basic recommended variable is <<dd_docx_display italic: "kidsn_hh17">>, however, it is not available for UK. For UK use <<dd_docx_display italic: "kidsn_hh15">> as a separate variable or – if it suits the research goal – combine both variables. Note that for Russia, <<dd_docx_display italic: "kidsn_hh17">> refers to own children only.

Survey differed in criteria of children to which the questions referred to:

- definition of children, e.g. own-born, adopted, of other family members, any children 

- indication of the situation of children, e.g. living currently in household, living elsewhere, children ever had 

- age of children, e.g. any age, below 18 or 15 years old 

For precise information, please refer to original questions and definitions provided below. 

Additional notes: 

Australia

	- there are small and unexplained differences between CNEF’s d11107 and a variable based on the raw data – raw data were preferred 

	- there are alternative input variables for counting children, e.g. any children or dependent children 

	- Alternative: Number Of Dependent Children aged 0-14 yo (includes partner's children) based on hhd0_4, hhd5_9, hhd1014 

Korea 

	- complex information on own children – they are included in HH questionnaire and refer to the head / respondent 

	- number of HH members below 15/18 y.o. (existence of children in high school or younger) is not useful for counting own children since it covers the whole household (including e.g. respondent or grandchildren)

Russia

	- Note that kidsn_hh17 refers to Number Of Own Children

	- Information available from 2004

UK

	- no threshold for 18 y.o., only children aged 0-15 (plus detailed age ranges), and people 16+ 

	- additionally: Number of own children in the household, which includes natural children, adopted children and step children, under age of 16.

putdocx text ("Labour market situation"), bold font("", 15)
*==============================================================================

putdocx textblock begin, paramode
The goal of CPF is to offer a comprehensive view on the labor market situation of individuals. 
The main variable is employment status, which is presented in two versions. 
The 5-categorical variable (<<dd_docx_display italic: "emplst5">>) is harmonized for all countries. The 6-categorical variable (<<dd_docx_display italic: "emplst6">>) includes additionally a category “on leave”, but it is not available for Australia and partly for US (before 1976). 

<<dd_docx_display italic: "Empls*">> include following categories:

•	Employed – currently employed 

•	Unemployed (active) – not working and actively looking for work 

•	Retired, disabled – not working and left the labour market (retired or disabled) 

•	Not active/home – not active economically (not working, not searching for work), additionally not retired and not in education

•	In education – currently in formal education 

•	On leave (employed) – employed but temporarily on paid leave 

Employment status is based on multiple input variables. Prioritization of statuses is applied, so that, for example, being employed is prioritized over being in education. The priority is following:

1.	Employed

2.	Unemployed

3.	In education

4.	Retired, disabled

5.	Not active/home

<<dd_docx_display italic: "Emplst*">> do not always correspond to other binary indicators related to labor market situation, e.g. current working status or retirement status. For a more precise classification of unemployed and retired, see respective binary variables.

Two binary indicators of working status (<<dd_docx_display italic: "work_d, work_py">>) refer to the approach used in CNEF and are constructed in a different way than the employment status. 

Classification can differ from other specific variables (e.g. unemployed <<dd_docx_display italic: "un_act">>, retired <<dd_docx_display italic: "retf">>), due to prioritization of statuses and differences in classification rules. For example, in emplst5 retirement is classified primarily based on self-categorization, whereas in <<dd_docx_display italic: "retf">> it includes a more complex and precise set of criteria; additionally, in emplst5 the status can be updated by statuses with a higher priority (e.g. in education or unemployed).

Self-employment and entrepreneurship refers to the main job.

Alternative specification of self-employment is possible (see lower-level syntax): self-employed v1 (all without Family Business) - only SOEP; self-employed v3 (based on income from self-empl) - e.g. in SHP and SOEP. 

For HILDA, classification of self-employed is based on definition by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which includes 

	•	"Employee of own business" - people who work for their business which is incorporated 

	•	"Employer/ Self-employed /own account worker" refers to people who work in their own business which is not incorporated
	
Entrepreneurship combines information about self-employment with size of company (only for the main job). Entrep2 is fully harmonized and recommended. 

In most of the case, as entrepreneurs we consider people selfemployed (selfempl=1) who employ at least 1 person other than respondent (no of own employees>1 or size of company>1).

	o	Self-categorisation as retired & age 50+  

	o	Receives old-age pension & age 50+

	o	Age 65+  

There are various ways to define the retirement status. In CPF, we offer a combination of several approaches based on the available data. The input variables include working status, self-identification as retired, receiving retirement pension or other type of old-age benefit, and age. Depending on the institutional context, a definition of retirement can be related more to formal status, benefits, or working status. 

There are some differences between <<dd_docx_display italic: "retf">> and <<dd_docx_display italic: "emplst*">> due to different criteria and priorities in recoding. E.g. for <<dd_docx_display italic: "retf">>, we do not consider educational activity or active unemployment; <<dd_docx_display italic: "emplst*">> combines retired and disabled into 1 category.

Only for US, the values represent the original question. Additionally, the variable corresponds to CNEF e11101 – if it was available, we included it in CPF. For other countries, it can be estimated based on hours per week. (e.g. whweek*52) or month, however, we do not recommend it if it should reflect the actual working hours per year (in this case, number of months in which respondent was employed should be taken into account).

Because of differences in questionnaires, the size of respondent’s organization could not be fully harmonized. CPF offers then several alternative classifications which were available for at least a few countries. <<dd_docx_display italic: "Size5b">> is available for all countries except Germany (for which only <<dd_docx_display italic: "size4">> is available). 

For full harmonization, users may consider constructing categories of small, medium and large companies based on <<dd_docx_display italic: "size5b">> and roughly adjusting Germany based on <<dd_docx_display italic: "size4">> (e.g. by combining e.g. <10 with <20 as small). 
A raw number of employees (<<dd_docx_display italic: "size">>) is provided if available.

Additionally, surveys refer to either local workplace/location or the whole company (including branches). This may have important consequences for interpretation – in this case, separate “whole” and “local” approaches based on information provided below.

Depending on the original data, information on individual income is included in several variables based on:

-	source of income: 
	
	o	total income from jobs and benefits (<<dd_docx_display italic: "inctot*">>)
	
	o	from all jobs (<<dd_docx_display italic: "incjobs*">>)
	
	o	from main job (<<dd_docx_display italic: "incjob1*">>)

-	type of income: 
	
	o	gross (<<dd_docx_display italic: "*g*">>, e.g. <<dd_docx_display italic: "incjobs_yg">>)
	
	o	net (<<dd_docx_display italic: "*n*">>, e.g. <<dd_docx_display italic: "incjobs_yn">>)
	
-	reference period for <<dd_docx_display italic: "">>income 

	o	year (<<dd_docx_display italic: "*y*">>, e.g. <<dd_docx_display italic: "incjob1_yn">>)
	
	o	month (<<dd_docx_display italic: "*m*">>, e.g. <<dd_docx_display italic: "incjob1_mn">>)
	
	o	per hour (<<dd_docx_display italic: "*h*">>, e.g. <<dd_docx_display italic: "incjob1_hn">>)

This approach results in multiple variables but provides clear definitions. For analytical purposes, users can combine particular variables using the nominal values or relative values (e.g. percentiles). <<dd_docx_display italic: "Incjobs_yg">> is available for all countries except Russia. 

For some countries, the income variables are taken from the CNEF files: Australia, Switzerland and Germany.
CPF provides values as they are included in the source data, without any additional cleaning, imputation, conversion or inflation-adjustments. Values are in local currency. For details, please refer to survey documentation

CPF contains a range of socio-economic position scales or indexes based on respondents’ work status and occupation. Some surveys provided them in their datasets, for the rest they were calculated. 

If not available in original dataset, variables werecreated according to Ganzeboom (2010) algorithms with the help of iscogen STATA ado (Jann, 2019). See Ganzeboom (2010):  

http://www.harryganzeboom.nl/isco08/isco08_with_isei.pdf

The procedure should be based on ISCO level 4. However, if not available, the scale was based on ISCO level 2 codes converted to level 4 (multiplied by 100). In such cases, it is less precise. For comparative purposes, further categorization can be considered to obtain similar distributions across countries.
